## How to I streamed an online radio station through the terminal

the radio station in this post is the quran radio station at [Quran Radio Website](http://www.ertu.org/quran/QuranKareem.html).in this post I will explain in detail how I could stream the station through the terminal. if you just want to know the how-to skip to the end of this post.

## The website
in the beginning, I wanted to get the streaming link the website uses to recieve the data. the website uses [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com/) to stream the radio.Using the web browser's developer tools I found the script used to stream the radio station. the script included the url of the streamed data.
