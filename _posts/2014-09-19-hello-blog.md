I am Happy to write the first entry in my blog. I will try to write a blog post every
week about some devlopment work I made outside of study. If the week was so busy with Uni work, then I might just blog about it.


## Introduce yourself .. the classical interview question

don't get me wrong. I haven't been to that many interviews. but I think it is the first question the interviwers tend to ask and for a good reason.

so to answer the question, it is complicated. so maybe I will take about it more later. But long story short, I am an Egyptian, Muslim, brown, CS Major with alot of defficulties in his life, or so I believe. that's it for hello blog.
