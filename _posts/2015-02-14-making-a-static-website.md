## making a blog static website

In this post I will be talking about making a blog using a static website generator.
One of the famous ones is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). In layman terms, Jekyll allows you to make a blog with only your posts files and the theme you pick. 

## why a static website?
you might be wondering why would you use a static website. afterall, they are dumb and can't do much. but using a static website comes with benefits too.
1. easy to host: static website can be hosted on any hosting provide because every server provides the user with front-end data at the end.
2. easy to modify: you can modify your websites very easily. you don't need to handle wierd database and back-end issues. you can install themes instantly.
