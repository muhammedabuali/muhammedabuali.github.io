I am Happy to write the first entry in my blog. I will try to write a blog post every
week about some devlopment work I made outside of study. If the week was so busy with Uni work, then I might just blog about it. this is also my first blog ever I hope a blog will be useful at some point.</p>

<h3 id="introduce-yourself--the-classical-interview-question">Introduce yourself .. the classical interview question</h3>
<p><br />
don’t get me wrong. I haven’t been to that many interviews. but I think it is the first question the interviewers tend to ask and for a good reason.</p>

<p>so to resopond I would say, it is complicated. so maybe I will take about it more later. But long story short, I am an Egyptian, Muslim, brown, CS Major with alot of defficulties in his life, or so I believe. that’s it for hello blog.</p>
