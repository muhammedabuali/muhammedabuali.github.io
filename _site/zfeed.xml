        <title>Welcome to my blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am Happy to write the first entry in my blog. I will try to write a blog post every
week about some devlopment work I made outside of study. If the week was so busy with Uni work, then I might just blog about it. this is also my first blog ever I hope a blog will be useful at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduce-yourself--the-classical-interview-question&quot;&gt;Introduce yourself .. the classical interview question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
don’t get me wrong. I haven’t been to that many interviews. but I think it is the first question the interviewers tend to ask and for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so to answer the question, it is complicated. so maybe I will take about it more later. But long story short, I am an Egyptian, Muslim, brown, CS Major with alot of defficulties in his life, or so I believe. that’s it for hello blog.&lt;/p&gt;
